Homework Assignment #5

Details:

Create a new empty repository with a /test folder, and an /app folder.

Inside of the app folder, create a library (lib.js) and fill it with simple functions. These can serve any purpose you wish, such as generating a random number, or checking whether or not a string is a palindrome. Really, any kind of functions will do.

Inside the /test folder, create a simple test runner, and then write tests for the functions in your lib.js file. You should try to test that they return (or callback) the correct value when passed valid parameters, and that they return a predictable value (and don't crash) when passed invalid parameters.

This is open ended, and can take whatever form you wish.


Video Component:

Make a screencast showing off the code you wrote for this assignment. Walk us through your file(s), line by line, explaining what the code means and why you wrote it the way you did. Then, start your application from the command-line and interact with it to show off the required functionality. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go and explain what you're showing us.


Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).
